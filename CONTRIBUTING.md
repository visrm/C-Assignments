## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to xern6852@gmail.com.

## How can I contribute

### Pre-Contribution terms
- **Check the [discussions](https://github.com/visrm/C-Assignments/discussions)** for a list of common questions and problems.
- **Perform a cursory search** to see if the problem has already been reported,[like this](https://github.com/search?q=+is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom). If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

### Reporting Bugs
This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Project. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report 📝, reproduce the behavior 💻, and find related reports 🔎.

When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible. Fill out the required template, the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.
> Note: If you find a Closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues). After you've determined which repository your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information by filling in the template.

 Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.For example, start by explaining how you started, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal, or how you started otherwise.
- **When listing steps, don't just say what you did, but explain** how you did it.For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut or a command, and if so which one? 
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.** Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use Markdown code blocks.
- **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.** Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
- **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for the Project, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion 📝 and find related suggestions 🔎.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check this list as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please include as many details as possible. Fill in the template, including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues). After you've determined which repository your enhancement suggestion is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Provide specific examples** to demonstrate the steps.
- **Include copy/pasteable snippets** which you use in those examples, as [Markdown code blocks](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github#multiple-lines).
- **Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
- **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part of project which the suggestion is related to.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most users.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain project quality.
- Fix problems that are important to users.
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible Project.
- Enable a sustainable system for Project's maintainers to review contributions.

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in the template
2. Follow the [styleguides](#git-commit-messages)
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/collaborating-on-repositories-with-code-quality-features/about-status-checks) are passing
   
While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

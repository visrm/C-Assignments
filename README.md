## Introduction to C

- C is a **procedural programming language**. 
- It was initially developed by **Dennis Ritchie** in the year 1972. 
- It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write an operating system. 
- The main features of the C language include :
  - **low-level memory access**
  - **simple set of keywords**
  - **clean style**<br>
these features make C language suitable for system programmings like an operating system or compiler development. 
- Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from the C language
  - Like syntax of **Java**, **PHP**, **JavaScript**, and many other languages are mainly based on the C language. 
  - **C++** is nearly a superset of C language (Few programs may compile in C, but not in C++).
